// No changes detected that necessitate tests.

// .github/workflows/TestRun.yml
// This is a configuration file for GitHub Actions, and does not require a Kotlin test. A functional (integration) test of the whole application that checks the build process would be most appropriate.  Since we don't have the full application setup details, it's impossible to write a truly useful test.  However, a test confirming that the file parses as YAML can be useful to check file format.  Due to the limitations of not having the build context, this is only a demonstration of checking that a YAML file is parsable.

import io.kotest.core.spec.style.StringSpec
import io.kotest.matchers.shouldBe
import org.yaml.snakeyaml.Yaml
import java.io.File
import java.io.FileInputStream

class TestRunYamlTest : StringSpec({
    "TestRun.yml should be a valid YAML file" {
        // Given: the path to the TestRun.yml file.  Note: this assumes the test is run in an environment where the file exists.  In a real project, you would likely read the file contents from the resources directory.
        val filePath = ".github/workflows/TestRun.yml"

        // When: attempting to parse the file as YAML.
        val yaml = Yaml()
        val inputStream = FileInputStream(File(filePath))
        val data = yaml.load<Map<String, Any>>(inputStream)

        // Then: the data should be a non-empty map, indicating successful parsing.  We could add additional checks for structure, but without the full application context, it is difficult to confirm the structure.
        data.isNotEmpty() shouldBe true
    }
